### Symbolic Code Index. Instant Navigation.

**A deterministic code indexing and retrieval system for AI-assisted development.**


In Greek mythology, Hermes was the messenger of the gods, known for speed, travel, and delivering information between distant places, Most importantly he was the guide of travelers, the messenger of the gods, and the navigator between worlds.
Hermes follows the same philosophy for codebases.
It does not attempt to replace understanding.
Instead, it guides developers and AI agents through large repositories, helping them navigate directly to the symbols, files, and implementations they need.
The repository already contains the answer.

Hermes builds a rich, queryable symbol index of your entire codebase so LLMs can find the right code—fast. Instead of exploring millions of tokens, ask Hermes and jump directly to what matters.

# 📖 What is Hermes?

Hermes is a repository indexing and retrieval system that produces a structured symbol index (`hermes.json`) of your codebase.

You can then query this index using simple tools such as:

* grep
* jq
* ripgrep
* Claude Code
* Aider
* Custom agents

Instead of feeding your entire repository to an LLM, Hermes retrieves only the relevant functions, types, files, and locations.

```text
Repository
    │
    ▼
 Hermes Index
    │
    ▼
 grep / jq / rg
    │
    ▼
 Relevant Symbols
    │
    ▼
      LLM
```

# ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Index Generation

Hermes parses the repository using Tree-sitter and extracts:

* Functions
* Methods
* Structs
* Interfaces
* Constants
* Variables
* Imports
* File Locations

```bash
hermes -input .
```

Output:

```text
hermes.json
```

---

### 2️⃣ Query

Search for symbols using standard UNIX tools.

```bash
grep -C3 "ConfigureProvider" hermes.json
```

or

```bash
jq '.idx["ConfigureProvider"]' hermes.json
```

---

### 3️⃣ Navigate

Open the exact files and locations returned by Hermes.

No blind repository exploration required.

---

#### 📦 .hermesignore

Hermes supports a `.hermesignore` file to exclude files and directories that provide little or no value for code navigation.

Ignoring generated code, vendored dependencies, documentation, test fixtures, repository metadata, and build artifacts can significantly reduce index size, indexing time, and query noise.

A well-tuned `.hermesignore` helps Hermes focus on implementation code rather than auxiliary repository content.

### Example

```gitignore
# Repository metadata
.git/**
.github/**

# Dependencies
vendor/
node_modules/

# Documentation
docs/
*.md

# Generated files
**/zz_generated.*
**/*_generated.go

# Test fixtures
**/testdata/
**/*_test.go

# Build artifacts
dist/
build/
tmp/

# IDE files
.idea/
.vscode/
```

### Why Use `.hermesignore`?

- ⚡ Faster indexing
- 📉 Smaller index size
- 🎯 Better retrieval precision
- 💰 Lower token consumption
- 🔍 Reduced search noise

Hermes is designed around the principle that not all repository content is equally valuable for navigation. A carefully curated `.hermesignore` allows the index to focus on the code that matters most.

> **Tip:** For large repositories such as Kubernetes, Loki, or Terraform, excluding `.git/**`, vendored dependencies, generated files, and documentation can dramatically reduce index size while preserving the vast majority of implementation-relevant symbols.

---

# 🚀 Why Hermes Matters

Modern LLM workflows spend the majority of their time and tokens exploring repositories.

Typical workflow:

```text
Search
 ↓
Open File
 ↓
Wrong File
 ↓
Search Again
 ↓
Open More Files
 ↓
Find Implementation
```

Hermes transforms that into:

```text
Lookup Symbol
 ↓
Open Correct File
 ↓
Done
```

Benefits:

* Fewer file reads
* Lower token usage
* Fewer tool calls
* Faster navigation
* Lower latency
* Better agent performance

# 🛠️ Installation

## Prerequisites

Hermes requires:

- Go 1.24+
- Universal Ctags

### Install Universal Ctags

#### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt install universal-ctags
```

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S universal-ctags
```

#### macOS

```bash
brew install universal-ctags
```

Verify installation:

```bash
ctags --version
```

Expected output should contain:

```text
Universal Ctags
```
#### Linux / macOS

Install the latest release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aeres-u99/hermes/main/install.sh | bash
```

If `~/.local/bin` is not on your `PATH`, the installer will tell you how to add it.

Verify the installation:

```bash
hermes --help
```

```bash
hermes --help
```

#### Manual Installation

Download the appropriate binary from the GitHub Releases page.

Rename it to `hermes`, make it executable, and place it somewhere on your `PATH`:

```bash
chmod +x hermes-linux-amd64
mv hermes-linux-amd64 hermes
sudo mv hermes /usr/local/bin/
```

Verify:

```bash
hermes --help
```

## Upgrading

Run the installer again or Download manually and install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aeres-u99/hermes/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## Build Hermes

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aeres-u99/hermes.git
cd hermes
make
```

---

## Running Tests
> This is pending, but we do plan to add tests.
> Sadly this wasn't made using TDD
```bash
make test
```

---

## Cross-Platform Builds

Hermes uses CGo (via Tree-sitter), so cross-compilation requires a C cross-compiler for the target architecture — `GOARCH` alone is not enough.

### Linux arm64 (from Linux amd64)

Install the cross-compiler:

#### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
```

Build:

```bash
make build-linux-arm64
```

Output: `dist/hermes-linux-arm64`

Transfer the binary to your ARM machine and install:

```bash
scp dist/hermes-linux-arm64 user@arm-host:~
ssh user@arm-host 'sudo install ~/hermes-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/hermes'
```

---

### Linux amd64

```bash
make build-linux-amd64
```

Output: `dist/hermes-linux-amd64`

---

### macOS (run natively on the target Mac)

Darwin cross-compilation from Linux requires the macOS SDK and is not supported here. Run these on the Mac itself.

#### Apple Silicon (arm64)

```bash
make build-darwin-arm64
```

Output: `dist/hermes-darwin-arm64`

#### Intel (amd64)

```bash
make build-darwin-amd64
```

Output: `dist/hermes-darwin-amd64`

---

### Build all Linux targets at once

```bash
make build-all
```

Produces both `dist/hermes-linux-amd64` and `dist/hermes-linux-arm64`.

---

## Install Hermes

```bash
sudo install hermes /usr/local/bin/hermes
```

Verify installation:

```bash
hermes --help
```

---

## Generate Your First Index

```bash
hermes -input .
```

This generates:

```text
hermes.json
```

which can then be queried using:

```bash
jq -r '.idx | keys[]' hermes.json
```

or

```bash
jq -r '.idx["main.main"]' hermes.json
```

# 📊 Benchmarks

Hermes has been benchmarked against three real-world repositories of different scales.

| Repository | Files  | LOC  | Runtime (s) | Full Map Tokens | Query Tokens | Retrieval Reduction |
| ---------- | ------ | ---- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Kubernetes | 30,536 | 5.0M | 66.2        | 14.7M           | 2,059        | 99.986%             |
| Loki       | 17,160 | 510k | 11.6        | 8.4M            | 880          | 99.990%             |
| Terraform  | 5,411  | 667k | 13.8        | 2.0M            | 5,340        | 99.732%             |

---

## Cross-Repository Summary

| Repository | Exploration Collapse | Cost Reduction |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Kubernetes | 60.0%                | 49.6%          |
| Loki       | 50.0%                | 50.2%          |
| Terraform  | 62.5%                | 7.2%           |

* [Loki Benchmark](benchmarks/Loki-Report.md)
* [Terraform Benchmark](benchmarks/Terraform-Report.md)

## Retrieval Reduction

Hermes is a retrieval system, not a context-stuffing system.

| Repository | Full Map Tokens | Query Tokens |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Kubernetes | 14,718,000      | 2,059        |
| Loki       | 8,396,000       | 880          |
| Terraform  | 1,990,000       | 5,340        |

Hermes consistently reduces retrieval payloads by over **99.7%**.

The entire repository is never sent to the model.

Only the relevant symbols are retrieved.

---

# 🔎 First Lookup Accuracy

| Repository | First Lookup Correct  |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Kubernetes | ✅ Yes                 |
| Loki       | ✅ Yes                 |
| Terraform  | ❌ Required Refinement |

Hermes performs best when queried using specific symbols.

Broad interfaces and common method names may require one or more refinement steps.

---

# 📦 When To Use Hermes

Hermes is optimized for medium and large repositories.

| Repository Size      | Expected Benefit | Recommendation            |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| < 100 files          | Low              | Generally not recommended |
| 100 – 1,000 files    | Medium           | Situational benefit       |
| 1,000 – 10,000 files | High             | Strong benefit            |
| 10,000+ files        | Very High        | Primary target            |

Smaller repositories may not see enough benefit to offset indexing overhead.

---

# 🔄 Index Once. Query Many.

Index generation is a one-time operation.

The resulting index can be reused across:

* Feature development
* Bug investigation
* Architecture discovery
* Code reviews
* AI-assisted programming
* Documentation generation

```text
Repository
    │
    ▼
 Generate Index
    │
    ▼
  hermes.json
    │
    ├── Query #1
    ├── Query #2
    ├── Query #3
    ├── Query #4
    └── Query #N
```

The generation cost is paid once. Or, if post Query #1 the syntax or structure has changed significantly, regenerate the hermes.json to ensure that the map is not stale.

The retrieval benefit compounds over time.

# 🧭 Design Principles

### Retrieval Over Stuffing

Never send the entire repository to the model.

Retrieve only the relevant implementation details.

### Deterministic

Same repository → same index.

No embeddings.

No probabilistic ranking.

### Transparent

Indexes are human-readable and versionable.

You can inspect, diff, and audit every result.

### Tool Friendly

Works with standard UNIX tooling:

* grep
* jq
* rg
* awk
* sed

### Language Aware

Built on Tree-sitter.

Designed to understand source structure rather than plain text.

# ⚡ Quick Start

Hermes Help
```
❯ hermes --help
hermes - The Code Map you will Ever need!
For custom CTAGS path use Environment Variable HERMES_CTAGS for custom path
  -input string
    	Code to Parse (default "code.py")
  -output string
    	Code to Parse (default "hermes.json")
Have Fun

```

Generate an index:

```bash
hermes -input .
```

Search for a symbol:

```bash
grep -C3 "MyFunction" hermes.json
```

Retrieve with jq:

```bash
jq '.idx["MyFunction"]' hermes.json
```

Open the returned file and line.

Done.
