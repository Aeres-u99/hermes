# Benchmark Task

## Task Definition

Add additional context to provider initialization failures.

When provider initialization fails, include:

* Provider name
* Configuration source

in the error message returned to the user.

---

## Benchmark Goal

Measure how efficiently an LLM can locate the implementation responsible for provider initialization and error handling.

---

## Ground Truth

Actual files modified:

* `internal/terraform/node_provider.go` — ConfigureProvider error messages enriched with n.Addr.Provider and config.DeclRange
* `internal/terraform/eval_context_builtin.go` — BuiltinEvalContext.ConfigureProvider error path
* `internal/terraform/eval_context.go` — ConfigureProvider interface definition

| 1    | grep hermes.json "ConfigureProvider" — 38 symbol matches returned across providers, mocks, grpc  | 0            | 9,840           |
| 2    | Open internal/builtin/providers/terraform/provider.go — `terraform.Provider.ConfigureProvider` (incorrect: built-in meta-provider, not init infrastructure) | 1 | 11,939 |
| 3    | Refine: grep hermes.json "NodeApplyableProvider" — 3 matches, narrows to node_provider.go        | 0            | 13,081          |
| 4    | Open internal/terraform/node_provider.go (correct)                                               | 1            | 14,773          |

**Initial Query:** `ConfigureProvider` — returned broad results including gRPC wrappers, mock implementations, and the built-in terraform meta-provider.

**Incorrect Result:** `internal/builtin/providers/terraform/provider.go` — selected because `terraform.Provider.ConfigureProvider` appeared to be core provider initialization; it is actually the built-in `terraform` provider (metadata/state operations).

**Refinement:** Narrowed query to `NodeApplyableProvider`, which uniquely identifies the apply-phase provider node responsible for user-facing error messages.

**Final Result:** `internal/terraform/node_provider.go` reached at step 4.

# Conclusion

Navigation Reduction: 37.5% fewer tool calls (5 vs 8). Despite a false lead, the refined query reached the correct file at step 4 vs step 5 baseline.

Token Reduction: 8.7% fewer total tokens. The false lead (internal/builtin/providers/terraform/provider.go) and the required refinement step compressed savings from a theoretical 48.7% to 8.7%.

Cost Reduction: 7.2% ($0.0199 saved per run). Marginal benefit attributable to the imperfect first lookup. Demonstrates that query precision is a significant variable for smaller repositories with broadly-implemented interfaces.

Time Reduction: 20.0% fewer steps to correct file (step 4 vs step 5).

Observed Outcome: Hermes located the target implementation but required one refinement step after an ambiguous initial result. The symbol `ConfigureProvider` spans 38 locations across interface definitions, gRPC wrappers, mock implementations, and the built-in meta-provider. On repositories of this scale (5,411 files), Hermes provides situational benefit dependent on query specificity. A precise initial query (`NodeApplyableProvider`) would have delivered full savings without the false lead.

# Retrieval Reduction Ratio

Query Amplification = (Hermes Query Tokens / Full Map Tokens) × 100

| Metric                | Value     |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Full Map Tokens       | 1,990,000 |
| Hermes Query Tokens   | 5,340     |
| Query Amplification   | 0.268%    |
| Reduction             | 99.732%   |

Hermes functions as a retrieval system, not a context-stuffing system. The grep payload delivered to the LLM is 373× smaller than the full map. However, `ConfigureProvider` is a broadly-implemented interface name spanning 38 symbol locations, producing the largest query payload of the three benchmarks (5,340 tokens vs 880 for Loki). This reflects a characteristic of the symbol, not of Hermes.

# Cross-Repository Scaling Analysis

| Repository | Files  | LOC       | Runtime (s) | JSON (KB) | Query Tokens |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Terraform  | 5,411  | 667,641   | 13.8        | 7,773     | 5,340        |
| Loki       | 17,160 | 510,562   | 11.6        | 32,797    | 880          |
| Kubernetes | 30,536 | 5,068,787 | 66.2        | 57,493    | 2,059        |

Key Observation: Repository size increases 6× in files and 10× in Go LOC across benchmarks. Query token consumption does not scale proportionally — it is governed by symbol frequency across implementations, not repository size. Hermes scales sub-linearly from a retrieval perspective.

---

# Hermes Target Repository Size

Hermes is designed primarily for medium and large repositories where repository exploration constitutes a significant portion of LLM token usage.

| Repository Size    | Expected Benefit    |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| < 100 files        | Not recommended     |
| 100–1,000 files    | Situational benefit |
| 1,000–10,000 files | Strong benefit      |
| 10,000+ files      | Primary target      |

Terraform (5,411 files) sits at the boundary between situational and strong benefit. This benchmark illustrates that benefit at this scale is query-precision-dependent: a broad interface name (`ConfigureProvider`) produced an imperfect first lookup and marginal savings (7.2%), while a precise symbol (`NodeApplyableProvider`) would have delivered the full theoretical savings (~48%).

---

# Index Once, Query Many

Hermes index generation is a one-time cost per repository. Retrieval savings are realized on every subsequent query.

| Metric                      | Value  |
| --------------------------- | ------ |
| Index Generation Time       | 13.8 s |
| Token Savings per Query     | ~6,800 |
| Estimated Queries per Month | 50–200 |
| Break-even (queries)        | 3–5    |

At typical engineering team usage, the index cost is recovered within a few queries. Note that for smaller repositories, break-even takes longer — the savings-per-query are lower when the repository is small enough that baseline exploration is already efficient. The index should be regenerated only when significant structural changes are made to the codebase.
