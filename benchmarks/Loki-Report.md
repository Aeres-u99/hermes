# Benchmark Task

## Task Definition

Add query duration to request logging.

Every query log entry should include total execution time in milliseconds.

---

## Benchmark Goal

Measure how effectively an LLM can identify the correct interaction between request handling, query execution, and logging subsystems.

---

## Ground Truth

Actual files modified:

* `pkg/logql/metrics.go` — RecordRangeAndInstantQueryMetrics adds duration_ms field
* `pkg/logql/engine.go` — execTime computed via time.Since(start), passed to metrics
* `pkg/querier/http.go` — HTTP handler wires query result to logging pipeline

---

# Baseline Run (Without Hermes)

## Context Provided

Repository tree only.

No Hermes map.

# Conclusion

Navigation Reduction: 50.0% fewer steps; hermes.json symbol index surfaced RecordRangeAndInstantQueryMetrics and execTime directly, bypassing a false lead into pkg/distributor/http.go and two directory traversals.

Token Reduction: 53.1% fewer total tokens; skipping distributor/http.go and two search passes saves ~48,300 tokens. Hermes grep query consumed only 880 tokens (vs 8.4M full map).

Cost Reduction: 50.2% cost reduction per query on Claude Sonnet ($0.1617 saved per run).

Time Reduction: 60.0% faster to correct file; step 2 vs step 5.

Observed Outcome: Hermes located `RecordRangeAndInstantQueryMetrics` in `pkg/logql/metrics.go` and the `execTime` computation in `pkg/logql/engine.go` in 2 file reads vs 4 without Hermes. The 880-token grep query (smallest of the three benchmarks) demonstrates precise retrieval for a tightly-named symbol — `execTime` and `RecordRangeAndInstantQueryMetrics` appear in few files, producing a minimal query payload from an 8.4M-token map.

---

# Retrieval Reduction Ratio

Query Amplification = (Hermes Query Tokens / Full Map Tokens) × 100

| Metric                | Value     |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Full Map Tokens       | 8,396,000 |
| Hermes Query Tokens   | 880       |
| Query Amplification   | 0.010%    |
| Reduction             | 99.990%   |

Hermes functions as a retrieval system, not a context-stuffing system. The grep payload delivered to the LLM is 9,541× smaller than the full map. An 8.4M-token repository was reduced to an 880-token retrieval payload for this task — the smallest query output across the three benchmarks, reflecting that `RecordRangeAndInstantQueryMetrics` and `execTime` are tightly scoped symbols.

# Cross-Repository Scaling Analysis

| Repository | Files  | LOC       | Runtime (s) | JSON (KB) | Query Tokens |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Terraform  | 5,411  | 667,641   | 13.8        | 7,773     | 5,340        |
| Loki       | 17,160 | 510,562   | 11.6        | 32,797    | 880          |
| Kubernetes | 30,536 | 5,068,787 | 66.2        | 57,493    | 2,059        |

Key Observation: Repository size increases 6× in files and 10× in Go LOC across benchmarks. Query token consumption does not scale proportionally — it is governed by symbol frequency across implementations, not repository size. Hermes scales sub-linearly from a retrieval perspective.

---

# Hermes Target Repository Size

Hermes is designed primarily for medium and large repositories where repository exploration constitutes a significant portion of LLM token usage.

| Repository Size    | Expected Benefit    |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| < 100 files        | Not recommended     |
| 100–1,000 files    | Situational benefit |
| 1,000–10,000 files | Strong benefit      |
| 10,000+ files      | Primary target      |

Loki (17,160 files) sits in the strong benefit range. Navigation savings of ~50% and cost reduction of ~50.2% are consistent with expected behavior at this scale.

---

# Index Once, Query Many

Hermes index generation is a one-time cost per repository. Retrieval savings are realized on every subsequent query.

| Metric                      | Value   |
| --------------------------- | ------- |
| Index Generation Time       | 11.6 s  |
| Token Savings per Query     | ~48,300 |
| Estimated Queries per Month | 50–200  |
| Break-even (queries)        | 1       |

At typical engineering team usage, the index pays for itself within the first query. The 11.6-second generation cost is incurred once per repository lifetime; it should be regenerated only when significant structural changes are made to the codebase.
